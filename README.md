The goal of the work is to develop software for remote control of the developed system of  irrigation equipment. 
The idea of creating such a solution is to optimize the use of water by  sprinklers in the field and to automate the process of watering.

he goal of the work is to develop software for remote control of the developed system of 
irrigation equipment. The idea of creating such a solution is to optimize the use of water by 
sprinklers in the field and to automate the process of watering. The end user has the ability 
to control devices connected via Wi-Fi using a web platform. The device is also able to 
work fully autonomously because it analyzes data from connected sensors in real time. The 
main decision factor of sprinkler operation is the current value of soil moisture. In the work 
what is also taken into account is the protection against unexpected failures or unfavorable 
weather conditions, which would have a negative impact on the work of the sprinklers.
